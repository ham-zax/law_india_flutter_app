Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder,\u2013\u2013\n(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death; or\n\n(b) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or\n\n(c) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or\n\n(d) if the person committing the act by which the death is caused, knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.\n\nIllustrations.\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\u2019s death.\n\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\n\nException 1.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident: Provided that the provocation is not,\u2013\u2013\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;\n\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;\n\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\n\nExplanation.\u2014Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.\n\nIllustrations.\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\u2019s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.\n\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\u2019s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n\n(e) A attempts to pull Z\u2019s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\u2019s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\u2019s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\n\nException 2.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\n\nIllustration.\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\n\nException 3.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.\n\nException 4.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\u2019s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.\u2014It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.\n\nException 5.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\n\nIllustration. A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\u2019s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder."

A has used criminal force to Z.\n\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\u2019s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.\n\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\u2019s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\u2019s clothes or something carried by Z.

Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.\n\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z\u2019s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\u2019s consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.\n\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\u2019s consent.
